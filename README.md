This project was developed for the **Multimedia** course of the Master's degree in **Computer Science** at the University of Catania.

It is a **web app** built with **Flask** that allows users to apply **watermarks** to images in two different ways:

1. **Visible Watermark**  
   - Users can choose **where** to place the watermark.  
   - The **size** and **opacity** of the watermark can be adjusted.  

2. **Invisible Watermark**  
   - The watermark is hidden within the image using the **LSB (Least Significant Bit)** technique, ensuring the visual integrity of the original image.  

This project aims to provide an intuitive interface for easily applying watermarks.

## ⚙️ Usage
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
cd flask
python3 app.py
```
